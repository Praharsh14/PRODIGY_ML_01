# Linear-Regression-Model-for-House-Price-Prediction

### Problem Statement
A real state agents want the help to predict the house price for regions in the USA. He gave you the dataset to work on and you decided to use Linear Regressioon Model. Create a model which will help him to estimate of what the house would sell for.

Dataset contains 7 columns and 5000 rows with CSV extension. The data contains the following columns :

- 'Avg. Area Income': Avg. Income of householder of the city house is located in.
- 'Avg. Area House Age': Avg. Age of Houses in same city.
- 'Avg. Area Number of Rooms': Avg. Number of Rooms for Houses in same city.
- 'Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms': Avg. Number of Bedrooms for Houses in same city.
- 'Area Population': Population of city.
- 'Price': Price that the house sold at.
- 'Address': Address of the houses.

# Linear Regression Model
Linear Regression is a statistical method that models the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. In this case, the independent variables are the features mentioned above, and the dependent variable is the house price.

The Linear Regression Model will be trained on the provided dataset to learn the relationships between the features and the house prices. Once trained, the model can be used to predict the selling price of houses for new data.
